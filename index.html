<a id="a-pvp-samp-server-script" class="anchor" href="#a-pvp-samp-server-script" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A PvP SA:MP server script</h2>

<p>The aim of the game is to find supplies such as tools or weapons to help you survive, either alone or in a group.</p>

<p>The overall objective is to build a stable community and defend it from players with more hostile intentions.</p>

<p>Items spawn around the map in various places categorised by type, rarity and location. Vehicles are rare and spawn with damaged engines or tires and will usually spawn with loot inside the trunk.</p>

<p>No gameplay mechanics require the use of commands. All gameplay has been built with an intuitive <em>interaction model</em> in mind with only 5 major keys required to access the gamemode-specific features.</p>

<h2>
<a id="development" class="anchor" href="#development" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Development</h2>

<p>The gamemode is written in a modular fashion, borrowing a lot of concepts from object-oriented programming. The "World" scripts are separated and can be completely replaced for a new map.</p>

<p>I encourage people to play around with this code, create a new map and put loot spawns in it or completely mod it into a new gamemode, I would love to see what creations are made! Please publish all bug fixes in order to benefit everyone.</p>

<h3>
<a id="dont-be-selfish" class="anchor" href="#dont-be-selfish" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Don't Be Selfish</h3>

<p>When you fix something, don't keep it to yourself. This is an open source project. An important part of open source is sharing, that's why this code is free of charge and available to all.</p>

<p>Please respect this. Feel free to keep your unique features private, just submit <em>all</em> fixes to the base code as pull requests or just email them to me.</p>

<h3>
<a id="builds" class="anchor" href="#builds" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Builds</h3>

<p>Each time I compile a version of the gamemode, the build number (stored in BUILD_NUMBER) is incremented. This is also shown in-game at the top-right of the screen and will allow players and developers to know which version is in use which can help track issues and fix bugs.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE THE BUILD SCRIPT YOURSELF! The reason for this is that you'll change the build number which is meant to reflect which BASE version of the gamemode you are using, NOT your own builds. This will greatly improve my ability to fix issues on your server.</p>

<h2>
<a id="setup" class="anchor" href="#setup" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setup</h2>

<p><strong>What version do I use?</strong></p>

<p>If you're running a <em>public server</em> use the latest <a href="https://github.com/Southclaw/ScavengeSurvive/releases">release</a>. It <em>should</em> be stable but remember, this is a constantly evolving project and bugs always slip through!</p>

<p>If you want to hack on the code and contribute, pull the latest commit.</p>

<h3>
<a id="1-dependencies" class="anchor" href="#1-dependencies" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1. Dependencies</h3>

<p>Ensure you have ALL the dependencies listed in the master script (the one you compile from!) each #include line has a link to the release page.</p>

<h3>
<a id="2-scriptfiles-directory" class="anchor" href="#2-scriptfiles-directory" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2. <code>scriptfiles/</code> directory</h3>

<p>The server will automatically create any required directories such as <code>scriptfiles/data/</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to use the maps provided in the repository, extract <code>scriptfiles/Maps.zip</code> to <code>scriptfiles/</code></p>

<h3>
<a id="3-compile" class="anchor" href="#3-compile" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3. Compile!</h3>

<p>If you have a problem compiling <strong>DON'T SUBMIT AN ISSUE HERE!</strong> this is reserved for actual bugs.</p>

<p>If you set up all the dependencies correctly, there should be <em>no</em> errors or warnings at all unless mentioned in the commit message.</p>

Set up plugins and filterscripts in your <code>server.cfg</code> file.</h3>

<p>Note: The repo contains <em>many</em> filterscripts, most of these are just testing tools and utilities, there are only <em>2</em> filterscripts you need to run on a public server:</p>

<pre><code>filterscripts object-loader rcon
plugins streamer sscanf CTime Whirlpool FileManager irc
</code></pre>

Set up gamemode settings in your <code>scriptfiles/SSS/settings.ini</code> file</h3>

<p>This is an INI file with game settings that will self-create if absent.</p>

<p>Most of the settings should be self-explanitory. If the purpose isn't clear, look up the setting in the source code for more information.</p>
