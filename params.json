Vehicles are rare and spawn with damaged engines or tires and will\r\nusually spawn with loot inside the trunk.\r\n\r\nNo gameplay mechanics require the use of commands. All gameplay has been built\r\nwith an intuitive _interaction model_ in mind with only 5 major keys required\r\nto access the gamemode-specific features.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nThe gamemode is written in a modular fashion, borrowing a lot of concepts from\r\nobject-oriented programming. The \"World\" scripts are separated and can be\r\ncompletely replaced for a new map.\r\n\r\nI encourage people to play around with this code, create a new map and put loot\r\nspawns in it or completely mod it into a new gamemode, I would love to see what\r\ncreations are made! Please publish all bug fixes in order to benefit everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\n1. **Dependencies**\r\n\r\n Ensure you have ALL the dependencies listed in the master script (the one you\r\n compile from!) each #include line has a link to the release page.\r\n\r\n2. **\"/scriptfiles/\" directory**\r\n\r\n Rename \"scriptfiles-folder\" to just \"scriptfiles\".\r\n The reason this folder has this name is because I don't want my actual\r\n scriptfiles folder on the repo as it contains various things I don't wish to\r\n share (such as user accounts and data for the test server) this may change.\r\n\r\n (However, the server will cleverly automatically create any missing\r\n files/folders when started so this repository folder isn't even required any\r\n more!)\r\n\r\n3. **Compile!**\r\n\r\n If you set up all the dependencies correctly, there should be *no*\r\n errors at all. If you have a problem compiling DON'T SUBMIT AN ISSUE HERE!\r\n that place is reserved for actual bugs.\r\n\r\n4. **Set up plugins and filterscripts in your _\"./server.cfg\"_ file.**\r\n\r\n Note: The repo contains *many* filterscripts, most of these are just testing\r\n tools and utilities, there are only *2* filterscripts you need to run on a\r\n public server:\r\n\r\n        filterscripts object-loader rcon\r\n        plugins streamer sscanf CTime Whirlpool FileManager irc\r\n\r\n5. **Set up gamemode settings in your _\"./scriptfiles/SSS/settings.ini\"_ file**\r\n\r\n This is an INI file with game settings that will self-create if absent.\r\n Not all settings must be present, here is an example:\r\n ```\r\n player/max-tab-out-time=600000\r\n player/combat-log-window=30\r\n player/interior-entry=0\r\n autosave/autosave-toggle=1\r\n autosave/autosave-interval=60000\r\n vehicle-spawn/spawn-chance=5.0\r\n ```\r\n\r\n6. **Enjoy!**\r\n\r\n ~~Do whatever you want with it, but keep my name on it :)~~\r\n\r\n My lax approach to licensing doesn't apply any more! I use GPL now so read the LICENSE file for usage rights etc. :)\r\n",
